          slightly over 34 meters and a capacity of 1,300 people.

          The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːlqiːlaː]) is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors. 
          Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi.
          Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. 
          The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan, and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.
